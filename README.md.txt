# Restaurant Rating Prediction - Task 1

This project is part of the Cognifyz Machine Learning Internship program.

## Project Description
Built a machine learning model to predict restaurant ratings based on dataset features like location, cuisine, cost, and delivery options.

## Project Structure
- `Task1_Restaurant_Rating_Prediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook implementing the project.
- `Dataset.csv`: The restaurant dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `models/`: Contains saved machine learning model files.
- `results/`: Contains performance reports and sample predictions.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries used.

## Key Results
- Evaluated Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models.
- Best RÂ² score and RMSE achieved by Random Forest (insert actual score).
- Included feature importance and visualizations in the notebook.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Open and run all cells in `Task1_Restaurant_Rating_Prediction.ipynb`.
3. Results and models will be saved automatically in respective folders.
